Robot Fleet Monitoring Dashboard:
The **Robot Fleet Monitoring Dashboard** is a web-based application designed to monitor and visualize the real-time telemetry and operational status of multiple robots. This project was built as part of a Full-Stack Developer challenge to demonstrate end-to-end development skills including frontend, backend, WebSocket communication, and deployment.

Features:
**Real-Time Monitoring**
- Live updates of robot location, speed, battery level, and status
- WebSocket or polling integration for real-time telemetry data

**Interactive Dashboard UI**
- Dynamic charts and robot status cards
- Responsive layout for desktop and tablet views
- Robot-specific detail view

**Backend API & Data Handling**
- RESTful API to fetch and manage robot data
- Real-time data simulation or external telemetry source integration
- Node.js + Express backend (or your preferred stack)

**User Experience Enhancements**
- Loading indicators
- Alert system for robot warnings (e.g., low battery, disconnection)
- Search and filter functionality

Tech Stack:
**Frontend:**
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- React.js / Vanilla JS / Bootstrap (based on your implementation)
- Chart.js or Recharts for visualizing telemetry

**Backend:**
- Node.js + Express.js
- WebSockets (Socket.IO or native)
- MongoDB / MySQL (if using persistent data)

**Others:**
- Git & GitHub
- Deployment: Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages (frontend) + Render/Heroku (backend)
